POPOBlog
========

POPOBlog is my personal blog application written in PHP that I use
to host my blogs at http://susam.in/blog/ and http://cotpi.com/p/.

This application is not ready for use by others. The documentation is
skimpy. There are a couple of security issues as well that I need to fix
before I can consider this ready.

The license terms are messed up as well. While some PHP files are
released under 'Simplified BSD License', others are released under 'GNU
General Public License version 3'. This is an error. I intend to release
all the source code under 'Simplified BSD License'. I'll update all PHP
files later to be consistent with this.
